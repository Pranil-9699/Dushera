  <h1>Why Dussehra is celebrated</h1>
  <p>Dussehra is a Hindu festival that celebrates the victory of good over evil. It marks the end of the nine-day festival of Navaratri and the triumph of Lord Rama over the demon king, Ravana. In the Hindu epic, the Ramayana, Lord Rama is seen as an avatar (incarnation) of the god Vishnu, and the story of his victory over Ravana is seen as a metaphor for the victory of good over evil.</p>
  <p>Dussehra is also associated with the goddess Durga, who is seen as a symbol of strength and power. During Navaratri, Hindus perform puja (worship) to Durga and ask for her blessings and protection. On the tenth day, Dussehra, the goddess is seen as having vanquished the demon Mahishasura, and her victory is celebrated as a victory of good over evil.</p>
  <p>In many parts of India, Dussehra is also seen as a time to celebrate the beginning of the harvest season and to give thanks for a good harvest. It is a time of joy and celebration, and people participate in a variety of cultural events and activities to mark the occasion.</p>
